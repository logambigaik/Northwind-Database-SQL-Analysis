## üí° Key Analysis Highlights
1. **Sales Performance** - Identify top-selling products by revenue
2. **Customer Distribution** - Geographic spread analysis by country
3. **Inventory Management** - Products never ordered (left joins with NULL check)
4. **Employee Productivity** - Order handling metrics per staff member
5. **Supplier Impact** - Product distribution across suppliers
